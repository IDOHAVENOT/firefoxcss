# firefoxcss
transparancy

please bear with me. I have no knowledge of CSS coding what so ever. I merely combined code from other users. For who I am thankful that they shared before me.

userChrome.css

- transparant nav and title bar

- close button over favicon on hover

- hide tabbar if 1 tab open

- three window control button to top

- so much dirty fixing on margins :(

Feel free to make any adjustments, and let me know if you made improvements. Or did some clean up
